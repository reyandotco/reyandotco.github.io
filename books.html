        The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and pass. What was, what will be,
        and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.

      <p>Let the Dragon ride again on the winds of time.</p>
      <p>
        Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time&reg; by Robert Jordan has
        captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope,
        originality, and compelling characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that
        become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten
        when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age
        of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What
        was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.

        When The Two Rivers is attacked by Trollocs-a savage tribe of half-men,
        half-beasts- five villagers flee that night into a world they barely
        imagined, with new dangers waiting in the shadows and in the light.

        After serving out a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for
        her crimes, 18-year-old assassin Celaena Sardothien is dragged before
        the Crown Prince. Prince Dorian offers her her freedom on one condition:
        she must act as his champion in a competition to find a new royal
        assassin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her opponents are men-thieves and assassins and warriors from across the
        empire, each sponsored by a member of the king&rsquo;s council. If she
        beats her opponents in a series of eliminations, she&rsquo;ll serve the
        kingdom for four years and then be granted her freedom. Celaena finds
        her training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall,
        challenging and exhilarating. But she&rsquo;s bored stiff by court life.
        Things get a little more interesting when the prince starts to show
        interest in her &hellip; but it&rsquo;s the gruff Captain Westfall who
        seems to understand her best.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then one of the other contestants turns up dead &hellip; quickly
        followed by another. Can Celaena figure out who the killer is before she
        becomes a victim? As the young assassin investigates, her search leads
        her to discover a greater destiny than she could possibly have imagined.

        In the three kingdoms of Mytica, magic has long been forgotten. And
        while hard-won peace has reigned for centuries, a deadly unrest now
        simmers below the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the rulers of each kingdom grapple for power, the lives of their
        subjects are brutally transformed&hellip; and four key players, royals
        and rebels alike, find their fates forever intertwined. Cleo, Jonas,
        Lucia, and Magnus are caught in a dizzying world of treacherous
        betrayals, shocking murders, secret alliances, and even unforeseen love.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only outcome that&rsquo;s certain is that kingdoms will fall. Who
        will emerge triumphant when all they know has collapsed?
      </p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s the eve of war&hellip;. Choose your side.</p>
      <p>
        Princess: Raised in pampered luxury, Cleo must now embark on a rough and
        treacherous journey into enemy territory in search of magic long thought
        extinct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rebel: Jonas, enraged at injustice, lashes out against the forces of
        oppression that have kept his country cruelly impoverished. To his
        shock, he finds himself the leader of a people&rsquo;s revolution
        centuries in the making.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorceress: Lucia, adopted at birth into the royal family, discovers the
        truth about her past&mdash;and the supernatural legacy she is destined
        to wield.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heir: Bred for aggression and trained to conquer, firstborn son Magnus
        begins to realize that the heart can be more lethal than the

        When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in
        New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder― much less a
        murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and
        brandishing bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears into thin air.
        It&rsquo;s hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to
        everyone else and when there is nothing―not even a smear of blood―to
        show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?
      </p>
      <p>
        This is Clary&rsquo;s first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors
        dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It&rsquo;s also her first
        encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and
        acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into
        Jace&rsquo;s world with a vengeance when her mother disappears and Clary
        herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in
        ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly
        get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know&hellip;

        They have always scared him in the past &mdash; the Rangers, with their
        dark cloaks and shadowy ways. The villagers believe the Rangers practice
        magic that makes them invisible to ordinary people. And now 15-year-old
        Will, always small for his age, has been chosen as a Ranger&rsquo;s
        apprentice. What he doesn&rsquo;t yet realize is that the Rangers are
        the protectors of the kingdom. Highly trained in the skills of battle
        and surveillance, they fight the battles before the battles reach the
        people. And as Will is about to learn, there is a large battle brewing.
        The exiled Morgarath, Lord of the Mountains of Rain and Night, is
        gathering his forces for an attack on the kingdom. This time, he will
        not be denied&hellip;.
